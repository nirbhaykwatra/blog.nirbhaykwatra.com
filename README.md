## To-Do List
- ~~Create "img-header" field in front matter for "post" layout. Header should take an image which it displays on the top of every post page, behind the title and date, as well as on the home page as a banner/thumbnail for each post.~~
- ~~Create different layouts for film, game and programming post pages.~~
- Figure out a way to automatically create a new page with the category layout every time a new category is added to site.categories.
- Create About page with 2-column layout: Left side is a pane with rounded corners, featuring a headshot and truncated statistics below (such as age, location of birth, nationality, location of residence, hobbies, interests, skills). Right side is a 2-3 full paragraphs about my life (journey so far, how I was in school, hardships and how I persevered throughthem, how I followed my passions), my interests (more details about my love for art such as films, comics and games, of course).
- Add cool glow animation to title text when hovering over it.
- Add categories as small buttons to each post page. When clicked, user is taken to the page of the relevant category.
- Create hidden pages for hidden categories.
- Make theme/website responsive
