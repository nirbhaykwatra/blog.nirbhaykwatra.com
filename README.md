## To-Do List
- ~~Create "img-header" field in front matter for "post" layout. Header should take an image which it displays on the top of every post page, behind the title and date, as well as on the home page as a banner/thumbnail for each post.~~
- ~~Create different layouts for film, game and programming post pages.~~
- Figure out a way to automatically create a new page with the category layout every time a new category is added to site.categories.
