Thunderbolts* is a brilliant return to form for Marvel Studios. It's the first Marvel movie I have truly connected with in quite a while. Not only is the cast amazingly charismatic and the action done well, the characters are truly deep and bursting with emotion. The thesis of the film, while fairly simple, is ultimately sincere and thoughtful and makes this one of the best movies I have seen this year.
